## Some Tips from Recruiter

**Gov Tech**

Hey folks, a quick sharing on salary negotiation for fresh school leavers. First of all, it's important to understand if the organization you are looking at has an internal entry rate that they offer fresh graduates (HR people won't share much so better to ask people who applied or got in). If there isn't a strict entry rate, the best negotiation basis will be how your strength (backed by your past project experience) with the competencies required in the role that you applied for. Once you set negotiation from this angle, the conversation will be more towards your advantage as what you can focus on how you can value add, which is why they needed someone in to do. Hope this helps 😊

Setting context
* tldr: The quality of our lives/careers is determined by more than just compensation. Money is important (and don't let anyone convince you that it's not) but don't over-optimize for it. Even if you want to purely maximize profit, consider that if you also prioritize other goals as part of your long career, it can help you attain a richer life, financially or otherwise.
* Kenneth's pinned post 1: https://t.me/projectintern/6301 (on competitiveness, mental health, self-worth, and asking better questions about compensation)
* Kenneth's pinned post 2: https://t.me/projectintern/6511 ("success" is different for everyone and happens at different points in time for each individual)
* https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/ (pace, people, prestige, profit, learning)

Finding a great company for yourself goes beyond compensation (e.g. you wouldn't want high pay with terrible culture). The following articles are important for understanding that software engineers fundamentally create value, and how the best companies not only pay well to reward that, but also actively invest in creating an environment where people can grow and have impact.
